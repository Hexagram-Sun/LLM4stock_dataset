Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to determine what investors should keep an eye on this week. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer broke down the earnings calendar for the week. Schafer said, ""A key theme when you think about this week is really what have the interest rate hikes started to do to the economy."" Academy Securities Head of Macro Strategy Peter Tchir discussed what to expect from earnings season and what it may show about the state of the U.S. economy. Tchir said, ""I think you're going to see a little bit of tentativeness from companies about consumers. I think it's going to be a story about the U.S. consumer ... and global growth."" Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi provided his take on earnings and how other S&P 500 companies stack up to Nvidia (NVDA). Sozzi said, ""There is not going to be any year-over-year sales growth for the S&P 500 ... not every company is like Nvidia, not everybody is selling AI chips."" Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Ines Ferre broke down Nvidia's stock performance and how the hype behind AI has put pressure on second-quarter earnings. Ferre said, ""Goldman Sachs is saying now the key areas that investors will be watching for ... the health of the consumer, how much the consumer is willing to spend."" Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith discussed the outlook for Delta Air Lines (DAL) and what travelers can expect for the rest of the 2023 summer season. Smith said, ""We're marching toward some of those key time frames for a company in Delta and many of the others in trying to get back to that full capacity."" SEI Chief Investment Officer Jim Smigiel broke down the uncertainty that looms ahead of earnings season. Smigiel said, ""If we look at big banks ... they haven't really participated much in the year-to-date rally ... it's a sector we like."" Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research at Argus Research, provided his take on big bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) on tap to report this Friday. Biggar said, ""I think it's going to be not bank's finest hour in terms of earnings this quarter ... you've got slowing loan growth, less demand as you have much higher interest rates.""
