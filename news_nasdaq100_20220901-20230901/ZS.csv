Well, the company protects consumer data for Charles Schwab (SCHW), it created work-from-home platforms for government entities like the City of Los Angeles, and built e-commerce infrastructure for giant consumer goods manufacturer, Unilever (UL). As Zscaler CEO, Jay Chaudhry explained to Yahoo Finance, ""The world has to move to adapt new technologies, like Zero Trust. That's the real answer. Many companies are making progress, and many are behind."" Headquartered in San Jose, California, Zscaler operates in 185 countries around the world, with a workforce of more than 2500 employees. It trades under the ticker symbol (ZS), with shares up 270% since its first day of trading in 2018.  Zscaler’s flagship product is the ‘Zero Trust Exchange,' a cloud platform that’s distributed across more than 150 data centers around the world.
