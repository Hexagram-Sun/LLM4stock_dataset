However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=097189c1983ad2a98e61f9934ae7f0e7c1307851661ded41cbd06f931dac6bd9

Schafer said, ""A key theme when you think about this week is really what have the interest rate hikes started to do to the economy."" Academy Securities Head of Macro Strategy Peter Tchir discussed what to expect from earnings season and what it may show about the state of the U.S. economy. Tchir said, ""I think you're going to see a little bit of tentativeness from companies about consumers. I think it's going to be a story about the U.S. consumer ... and global growth."" Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi provided his take on earnings and how other S&P 500 companies stack up to Nvidia (NVDA). Sozzi said, ""There is not going to be any year-over-year sales growth for the S&P 500 ... not every company is like Nvidia, not everybody is selling AI chips."" Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Ines Ferre broke down Nvidia's stock performance and how the hype behind AI has put pressure on second-quarter earnings. Ferre said, ""Goldman Sachs is saying now the key areas that investors will be watching for ... the health of the consumer, how much the consumer is willing to spend."" Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith discussed the outlook for Delta Air Lines (DAL) and what travelers can expect for the rest of the 2023 summer season. Smith said, ""We're marching toward some of those key time frames for a company in Delta and many of the others in trying to get back to that full capacity."" SEI Chief Investment Officer Jim Smigiel broke down the uncertainty that looms ahead of earnings season. Smigiel said, ""If we look at big banks ... they haven't really participated much in the year-to-date rally ... it's a sector we like."" Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research at Argus Research, provided his take on big bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) on tap to report this Friday. Biggar said, ""I think it's going to be not bank's finest hour in terms of earnings this quarter ... you've got slowing loan growth, less demand as you have much higher interest rates.""

One of the big issues for Intel has been the slowdown in PC demand.

Right now, it’s shaping up to be a “goldilocks” scenario, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes tells Yahoo Finance Live. “We finally have a goldilocks scenario where the slowing is starting to kick in, the lagged effect is starting to kick in, and more than anything what that means for the Fed is it gives them cover to actually pause in September, which is kind of priced into the markets right now,” Hayes says. Although many investors believe the Fed will hike in November, “we are going to get a lot of inflation data between now and then” and “if those numbers continue to come in a little bit softer, the Fed may be done in terms of hiking, not done with tightening cause they’ll keep rates elevated for a little while,” which “creates this perfect scenario for stocks moving forward,” Hayes explains. Hayes also notes that with some softness in the labor market, quit rates declining, job openings softening, “that creates an environment where you're not going to have the wage price spiral, where you're not going to see this accelerating wage inflation, and that’s going to give a lot of comfort to the Fed.” Let the Fed “keep rates elevated” and have this “perfect situation where the economy is slowing a little bit, but the Fed is done tightening and then companies can start to perform,” Hayes explains. Hayes says for people expecting the “Magnificent 7,” Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), “to have a monster second half like they had the first half, I think they're going to be a little surprised.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bc2255da4e941c1cfebb5b1a5fbd6eafb101786beb06716ec932e50ffed02724

A ""Minsky moment"" ""refers to the onset of a market collapse brought on by the reckless speculative activity that defines an unsustainable bullish period,"" according to Investopedia. Investopedia Editor-In-Chief Caleb Silver joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. “I don’t think we've seen” a Minksy moment in AI, Silver says, “we’ve seen a nice healthy pullback after a really strong rally.” Investors are “worried we might be at the brink of something. Well, there’s really nothing to suggest that we are, except that psychological scar tissue of the fact that we’ve had two bear markets in the past two and a half years,” Silver adds. Silver says, “when we think about AI, the big question is, is all the hype priced into these stocks?” Silver notes that Nvidia has “a pretty healthy price-to-sales ratio and healthy but I mean, very big. But Nvidia’s got a lot going for it, it doesn’t just surround itself in the AI ecosystem.” “We’ve seen a big selloff in AI-related stocks lately, absent Nvidia... so some of the air may have been let out of the AI bubble a little bit and we're going to see which companies remain that have the most strength in that area and can use it to enhance their businesses and their profitability,” Silver explains.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c9dcf6542ef50614c1a5270c7b46677b532ae2fddd22d6dbafefdef5d3736b90

Axios Global Tech Correspondent Ryan Heath joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this means for chipmakers and for the future of U.S. and China relations.

Heath says Raimondo ""is extremely well regarded by the White House"" and ""is treated as a serious player by the people she is talking to in Beijing, you know, that’s exactly the right person that you want there having these discussions.
