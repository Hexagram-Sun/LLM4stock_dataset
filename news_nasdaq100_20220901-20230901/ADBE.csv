Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs U.S. Software Equity Research Analyst, explains ""three big things"" to look out for from the conference. Rangan says what he's telling clients ""to look for is what kind of uptick we’re going to see with generative AI"" in calendar ’24. Rangan notes that ""we’ve seen a slew of launches"" from companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), and Adobe (ADBE), and these companies are hoping ""to get more customer wallet share in return for all the productivity."" ""So when is that going to start to really manifest in revenue?,"" Rangan says. The second thing is ""what’s happening with macro?,"" Rangan says. Last year, ""we were heading into this inflation spiral... company growth rates start to really decelerate,"" Rangan notes, but ""now, we’re at a point where things are stabilizing."" So, Rangan says, ""what is your macro outlook? What is the pulse of the spending environment?"" and ""what do budgets for calendar ’24 look like?"" The third thing is, ""when are you going to start to hire?,"" Rangan says. ""There’s no growth in the software industry unless you really hire,"" Rangan explains. We’ve seen layoffs and hiring freezes, but when is ""that going to start to turn around?,"" Rangan adds.
