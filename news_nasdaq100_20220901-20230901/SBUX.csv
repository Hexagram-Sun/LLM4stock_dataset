However, tensions between the coffee giant and workers continue as unionization efforts unfold. Starbucks barista Michelle Eisen says a higher starting wage, more hours, and 100% health coverage are high on the list of priorities for workers. In an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Akiko Fujita, Eisen criticizes the coffee chain’s profits as workers fight for the aforementioned demands. ""A lot of times, to get those profits, things have been taken away in other levels,"" Eisen says. ""In the case of the employees, we're seeing reduction in our hours, we're seeing labor being cut.” For Eisen, the only way Starbucks guarantees workers will have their rights is through a signed contract. ""We need assurances,"" she said. ""The only way to ensure our hours will not be cut is through a contract that says, no we won't treat our workers this way.""Key Video Moments 00:00:00 Starbucks workers demands00:00:29 Starbucks profits00:00:55 Workers seek reassurance",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a30e07f0643d8d2b924602d48f133a3101a9d2ecaed189aca416e0c2e6be4e5b

In addition, Narasimhan says that cold foam is now ""the fastest-growing customization at Starbucks."" Overall, Narasimhan says customizations, such as cold foam, ""contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually."" So who is buying all of those drinks? Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri tells Yahoo Finance Live ""it's definitely skewed more towards a younger consumer. We have a large consumer base of millennials and Gen Z and their taste and preferences tend to be more cold."" ""It is definitely an increasing trend and we don't see it going away,"" Ruggeri adds. Ruggieri says that, overall, beverage sales grew by 10% in the quarter. ""We did see growth of about 2% weighted on that 10% from a hot perspective, but we also saw cold grow about 8%,"" Ruggeri said. Recently, Starbucks has started changing out ice cubes for ice nuggets. Ruggeri says part of the reason the company is making the switch is to nugget ice is because of the cold drink demand. Ruggeri says the nugget ice blends faster and that eventually it will be piped into the stores so employees don't have to carry buckets of ice.
