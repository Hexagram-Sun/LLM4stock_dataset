The company once vowed to be a disruptor to the media industry, but could not figure out a way to turn a profit. Washington Post media reporter Elahe Izadi says digital media organizations made the following claims early on, ""We are the future of media. We can attract millennials, younger audiences, newspapers are dying, print is dying, and this is really the future and they sold this promise, and as we can see, they couldn't grow fast enough to make up for those promises, especially when we're now in an economic environment where the advertising industry and the and the advertising revenue has dropped off."" Its potential downfall underscores the tough environment facing digital media companies as they struggle to cut spending during economic uncertainty. ""When we're talking digital media... during the pandemic and especially at the start, we actually saw audience spike, there was a lot of online interest, reader interest saw a lot of that happening, but that didn't necessarily mean an increase in revenues,"" Elahe Izadi said. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Izadi also says that in the case of companies relying on other companies like those who rely on Google (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), their businesses can also be susceptible to disruptions from something like a changed algorithm.

Senior Media & Internet Analyst. Martin joined Rachelle Akuffo on Yahoo Finance live to talk Warner Bros. Discovery (WAB) earnings, which showed the company's streaming platforms will turn a profit a year earlier than expected. Still, Warner Bros. Discovery faces challenges with ""a broken film content creation engine"" that's been on a ""cold spell"" for the past five years, says Martin. Apple is a strong distribution platform, and would stand to benefit from buying a ""successful and healthy film studio."" Enter: Disney. If they combined, Apple (AAPL) and Disney (DIS) would stand to benefit from ""a lot of synergies"" between Apple's strong distribution network of iPhones and Disney's powerhouse content, says Martin. But hope is not lost for Warner Bros. Discovery. The company has a ""big library"" of names, with plans to launch another Superman movie to bolster the D.C. Comic brand. Martin says she expects Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to look to Paramount (PARA) as a potential acquisition opportunity, given Paramount's recent sliding stock. Martin says Warner Bros. Discovery is ""just managing the same company"" as Paramount, but better. In her full interview, Martin dives deeper into Warner Bros. Discovery earnings with Rachelle Akuffo.

It's $3,499 price tag however may turn off a lot of buyers. Laura Martin, Senior Media and Internet Analyst at Needham & Co., however, has an idea. Martin suggests that Apple (AAPL) should buy Disney (DIS) to help build adoption of the new headset. Martin argues that Apple needs ""a compelling content storytelling use case"" for the Vision Pro to gain traction. She believes that with Disney's content, more people may be willing to purchase the headset. But what about the Disney parks? Martin says Apple likely won't want the parks, but that those could be spun off or sold, given they are ""really a good business, standalone."" Martin also covers Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). When asked about the ousting of CNN CEO Chris Licht, Martin says investors are betting more on WBD leadership than who is leading CNN. She also makes the case for WBD keeping CNN in its portfolio. ""The only way to win the streaming wars is you must have entertainment content, and you must have news, and you must have live sports,"" Martin says, because when news breaks, it drives viewers to your app. When it comes to the ongoing writers strike and a potential strike from SAG-AFTRA, Martin tells Yahoo Finance Live's Diane King Hall and Alexandra Canal that Wall Street investors will ultimately be the winners because ""all of these companies are not going to be able to spend money on content and that won't be a competitive disadvantage.""

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings. Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible."" Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=86e5c718a7671d9865ed7fe44a96e78a9ac82fb90f7f717b740b28d46b4c97ae

So they’re the size of like a couple of major studios combined, so I don’t know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out.” “Whenever these studios are in trouble, it’s like the finance team takes over and it just doesn’t make sense,” Douglas says. “These studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses. Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it.
