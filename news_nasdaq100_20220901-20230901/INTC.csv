However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=097189c1983ad2a98e61f9934ae7f0e7c1307851661ded41cbd06f931dac6bd9

In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says he thinks ""the worst is behind us at this point and our raise to the guide for Q3 really portends to a more optimistic future."" One of the big issues for Intel has been the slowdown in PC demand. On that Gelsinger says the company is ""expecting nice quarter-on-quarter improvements"" in that business, partly due to inventory adjustments. When it comes to AI, Gelsinger explains there are a couple of reasons why Intel's name isn't mentioned much in the conversation. One of the reasons Gelsinger gives is that ""we haven't been as aggressive out of the chute as we should've been."" Gelsinger says the company has to prove itself because ""we have a clear market leader who is executing very well."" Gelsinger says rival Nvidia (NVDA) ""has done a good job in this space. They've really led the way and I like to say, they worked super hard and they got lucky."" However, Gelsinger notes the AI space is still ""fairly young"" and there is still ""a lot of opportunity"" for Intel.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=932bf7a8419602ec1a29ddde17d09f0f8c66997e9d4b3a09434c957736a657de

Major semiconductor manufacturers such as Micron (MU), Intel (INTC), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), have made large investments in the U.S., but so far labor shortages and construction issues have delayed operations. Aaron Chatterji, Duke University Professor of Business and Public Policy, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the CHIPS Act and the state of the U.S. semiconductor industry. Chatterji, who is also the Fmr. White House CHIPS Coordinator and Fmr. Acting Deputy Director of the National Economic Council in the Biden Administration, remains positive about the effectiveness of the CHIPS Act. With over 460 companies interested in using CHIP subsidies, Chatterji broke down what makes the best candidate for funding. Chatterji said, ""When you're thinking about companies ... at the top of that list is American national security.
