How to tackle crypto lossesDuring a volatile year for crypto investors, it's important to understand the rules surrounding tackling losses on your tax return. “Crypto is just like a stock investment if you are holding onto it as an investment,” Lisa Greene-Lewis, TurboTax CPA and tax expert told Yahoo Finance Live. “The way you use crypto is how it's taxed.” Did you know that you can deduct up to $3,000 of your capital losses against your ordinary income? This means that if you experienced a net capital loss during the year, you could use up to $3,000 to offset your ordinary income, such as your salary and wages.
